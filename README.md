# Code Insights

## Folder structures

### mode
- This folder is dedicated to organize the game mode
- Each game mode has its own implementation by implementing the `Mode` interface
### path

- Responsible for managing the object structure of `Path` by favoring composition over inheritance
- `Path` has `Step`s and each `Step` has a `Direction`, `Color` and `Location`

### state

- Decouple the logic from the UI components provided by JavaFX

### view
- Controlling all the UI widgets
- To do so, we harness the power of the **Observer pattern**
- That is, whenever a UI component state is changed, other components interested in the state changes are notified and thus reflect on it
### util
- Helper classes that may not directly correlated to the game itself
